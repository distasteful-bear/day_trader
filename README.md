Hello! 

This is a day trader game which is my first application in python.
It is not rocket science, but I am enjoying the process. I hope
you find it interesting. 

If you have any thoughts I would love to hear them, particularly 
about my algorithm for the change of a stock's value in a day. 

My email is distasteful.bear@gmail.com for all messages related to my
GitHub, but all my verfified comments are signed with jamesmetz1231@gmail.com

(Also bug reporting would be valuable and GitHub works well for that.)

Cheers!
