Hello! 
This is a day trader game which is my first application in python.
It is not rocket science, but I am enjoying the process. I hope
you find it interesting. 

If you have any thoughts I would love to hear them, particularly 
about my algorithm for the change of a stock's value in a day. 
My email is distasteful.bear@gmail.com

(Also bug reporting would be valuable and GitHub works well for that.)

Cheers!
